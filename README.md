RedBot Odom

Using the [SparkFun RedBot](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12649) as the development platform and
ros [differential\_drive](https://github.com/sterlingm/differential-drive) ported for ROS indigo,
as well as [ros\_android\_sensors](https://github.com/yycho0108/ros_android_sensors) from my previous development,
and finally [robot\_localization](http://docs.ros.org/kinetic/api/robot_localization/html/index.html)
this project tackles robot localization through encoder-based odometry sensor fusion with IMU and GPS.
